[git init is used to start a project newly.Whenever we are working with vs code and we wants to start a new project for our work in the terminal we will be first coding "git init" to initialise the project.]

### git add
[git add is used when we have made some changes with the existing code,newly writing the code,deleting the code in all these cases we are using git add to take the changes into a staging area.we can use git add in two ways either we can add all the files together using "git add ." or we can seprately choose them by mentioning the file names like "git add <filename>".]

### git commit
[git commit is used to save the code with a message.imaging we have added a set of code into the staging area now we wants to save them for this we are using git commit here the specialty is that we can make a message along with that so in future it helps us to get the details.]

### git push
[git push is used to bring the saved changes from the local repositoty to our remote repository.imagine we have saved something in my computer now to take this change to the github we can use git push.the command is "git push -u origin main".]
